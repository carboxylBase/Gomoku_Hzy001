# Gomoku AI -- Hzy001
## Why did I develop this AI?
+ This is my metalworking internship assignment. Two other classmates and I need to collaborate to create a robot that can play Gomoku. This robot consists of three parts: mechanical control, vision system, and chess algorithm. The code for the chess algorithm is recorded in this repository.
+ In my freshman year, my C++homework was also Gomoku - a 2000+line C++file without header files, classes, encapsulation, or git. The only advantage was that it could indeed run. Now that I am a sophomore, I have participated in Robocup and ACM series competitions in the past year, and my engineering code and algorithm abilities have improved significantly. I want to develop a better AI based on my previous foundation.
+ I hope to complete the introductory learning of AI through this project.
